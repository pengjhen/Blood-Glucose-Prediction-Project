# Blood Glucose Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting blood glucose levels for patients with Type I diabetes. The aim is to explore and compare different time-series forecasting methods, specifically by using ARIMA models implemented in R and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models built with Python. The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the Kaggle competition on blood glucose prediction.

The primary goal of this project is to practice and refine skills in Python and machine learning, particularly in time-series forecasting and deep learning techniques. Through this project, I aim to enhance my understanding of both traditional statistical models and deep learning approaches for time-series data, as well as the strengths and limitations of each.

### Project Goals

Develop Machine Learning and Python Skills: This project is part of my journey to deepen my expertise in Python and machine learning, particularly focusing on time-series prediction tasks.
  1. Model Comparison: Implement and evaluate two different time-series models:
     ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), a classic statistical model for time-series forecasting, using R.
     LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of recurrent neural network suited for sequential data, using Python.
     XGboost: ...

  2. Blood Glucose Prediction: Explore how each model performs in predicting future blood glucose levels, with the goal of gaining insights into the practical applications and performance differences between traditional statistical and deep learning models.
