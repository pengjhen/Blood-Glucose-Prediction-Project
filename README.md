# Blood Glucose Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting blood glucose levels for patients with Type I diabetes. The aim is to explore and compare different time-series forecasting methods, specifically by using ARIMA models implemented in R and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models built with Python. The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the Kaggle competition on blood glucose prediction.

The primary goal of this project is to practice and refine skills in Python and machine learning, particularly in time-series forecasting and deep learning techniques. Through this project, I aim to enhance my understanding of both traditional statistical models and deep learning approaches for time-series data, as well as the strengths and limitations of each.
